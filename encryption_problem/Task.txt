You have implemented a new encryption algorithm.
In that algorithm, the key is calculated as X^P,
where:
    - X and P are natural numbers
    - P >= 1

For given 2 numbers, MIN and MAX,
calculate how many different keys you can
create in the range [MIN, MAX].

Constraints: 1 <= MIN <= MAX <= 10^18
